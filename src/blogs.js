    blog: "India is the 2nd largest producer of tea in the world, with more than 900,000 tonnes per year. Tea was introduced to India by the British in the nineteenth century, to overcome the monopoly of Chinese production. The first area to be planted was the mountain region surrounding the city of Darjeeling, perched on the Himalayan foothills, in the 1850s. Then came the development of tea cultivation on the plains of Assam. Here, a wild species of tea was found and brought under cultivation. This variety was closely related to the Chinese tea plant, camellia sinensis assamica, which had been imported by the English. It had larger leaves than its Chinese counterpart and flourished best in the plains, whereas the Chinese Camellia preferred altitude. Finally, in the late nineteenth century, the British set up tea plantations in the mountainous region of the southern tip of India, including the famous Nilgiri massif. Nilgiri means 'Blue Mountain'. Some say this is because of the fog enveloping the mountain, which gives it a blue sheen.",

      "We offer a particular blend of tea known as Darjeeling Gardens, a beautiful blend of different Darjeeling tea estates. The Tea Board of India has been fighting for years to defend the production of this region. In 1983, it created a logo to defend and lobby for a specific Darjeeling label of origin. A case was presented to the European Union to begin the process of recognizing this region as a PGI (Protected Geographical Indication). Since October 20th, 2011, Darjeeling has indeed been recognized as a PGI *.There are 87 tea gardens which can use the PGI label, located between 600 and 2250m above sea level in the mountains surrounding the town of Darjeeling. This designation applies only to black tea. Other colors of tea are nevertheless produced in the region, but in very small amounts compared to black tea. Each Darjeeling tea plant should not produce more than 100g of manufactured tea per year, i.e. a total annual production of 9 to 10 million kg, bearing in mind that the world's annual tea production is more than 3.8 million tonnes.",

    blog: "Tea and India go back a long way. In fact, it first appeared in the ancient scripts of the Ramayana. According to legend, Lakshman, the brother of Lord Rama was injured in a battle with Ravana. Hanuman, Lord Rama’s pupil was sent to bring the ‘Sanjeevani Booti’, a plant found only in the Himalayas. The leaves of this plant were applied to Lakshman’s wounds and he healed miraculously. Sanskrit scholars believe the ‘Sanjeevani Booti’ is tea itself.The tribal in India enjoyed a hot cup of tea by brewing the tea leaves in hot water. Deeming the leaves as valuable, they started trading the leaves for other goods. It was in one such trade market that a young Scottish adventurer, Robert Bruce encountered these leaves. He noticed the locals brew the leaves of this wild plant. Intrigued by this practice, Bruce met the local chief Bessa Gam and arranged to procure the leaves to get them scientifically examined.",

Today, you’ll find a tea stall at every nook and corner of major cities in India with each having their own version of the tea. People from Delhi prefer the ‘Malai-maarke’ version which is Indian Masala Chai served with a dallop of fresh cream while Mumbaikars love their ‘cutting chai’ or half a cup of tea. The highways of Northern India are marked by smaller outlets that brew and serve tea in earthen pots called ‘khullad’. Wherever you go in India, you’ll always find tea.",

The tea has a unique taste and is often described as being salty and slightly bitter, with a creamy texture due to the butter.

The tea has a mild, delicate flavour that is often described as being slightly floral or fruity.

Besides tracking a person’s movements, the Chinese government may be able to gather enough data to monitor a person’s activities, relationships and political views.  Another example is U.S. police departments embracing predictive policing algorithms to anticipate where crimes will occur. The problem is that these algorithms are influenced by arrest rates, which disproportionately impact Black communities. Police departments then double down on these communities, leading to over-policing and questions over whether self-proclaimed democracies can resist turning AI into an authoritarian weapon. “Authoritarian regimes use or are going to use it,” Ford said. “The question is, How much does it invade Western countries, democracies, and what constraints do we put on it?”",

Data may not even be considered secure from other users when given to an AI system, as one bug incident that occurred with ChatGPT in 2023 “allowed some users to see titles from another active user’s chat history.” While there are laws present to protect personal information in some cases in the United States, there is no explicit federal law that protects citizens from data privacy harm experienced by AI.

Widening socioeconomic inequality sparked by AI-driven job loss is another cause for concern, revealing the class biases of how AI is applied. Blue-collar workers who perform more manual, repetitive tasks have experienced wage declines as high as 70 percent because of automation. Meanwhile, white-collar workers have remained largely untouched, with some even enjoying higher wages.  Sweeping claims that AI has somehow overcome social boundaries or created more jobs fail to paint a complete picture of its effects. It’s crucial to account for differences based on race, class and other categories.
